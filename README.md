# MSBA-Capstone Project - Rachel Butterfield

Project Goal: Home Credit will be able to identify if a customer is a safe candidate to lend to, then create a personalized customer loan and repayment plan to be accountable for, resulting in an increase in revenue, improved customer experience, and lower default rates.

Business Problem: Home Credit desires to know safe borrowers in a customer base that is unfamiliar with banking and give the customer a plan for successful loan repayment. Lending to those who are more likely to default on loans decreases the profits of Home Credit and results in negative customer experiences.

Analytic Problem: The target variable is specificially customers that do have a negative history of repayment to lend to, and postive repayment. Represented in the application_train/test.csv sets of binary where 1 = Not trust worthy borrower (Client with payment difficulties), 0 = Trustworthy borrower (client with good repayment history).
