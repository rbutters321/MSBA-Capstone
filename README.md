# MSBA-Capstone Project - Rachel Butterfield

Project Goal: 

Home Credit will be able to identify if a customer is a safe candidate to lend to, then create a personalized customer loan and repayment plan to be accountable for, resulting in an increase in revenue, improved customer experience, and lower default rates.

Business Problem: 

Home Credit desires to know safe borrowers in a customer base that is unfamiliar with banking and give the customer a plan for successful loan repayment. Lending to those who are more likely to default on loans decreases the profits of Home Credit and results in negative customer experiences.

Analytic Problem: 

The target variable is specificially customers that do have a negative history of repayment to lend to, and postive repayment. Represented in the application_train/test.csv sets of binary where 1 = Not trust worthy borrower (Client with payment difficulties), 0 = Trustworthy borrower (client with good repayment history).

My individual contribution: 

In the inital EDA portion of this project I explored the scope of missing data in the training and test datasets. I examined all the variables in both sets by looking at the total count and percentage of missing values, examining a handful of the variables to see what the values were, identified possible outliers in the data. I also provided some strategic suggestions as to how to manage the missing data as we continue building out model.

In the modeling portion of this project I wrote all the code for the data cleaning and for the Gradient Boosted Tree Model. The modeling process took me between 30-40 hours, which was surprising to me. I vastly underestimated how much time the data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning, and other techinques like oversampling would take to figure out.
